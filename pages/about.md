  #### Hello! My name is Sriraj Aiyer. I am currently researching at the
  University of Oxford's Department of Experimental Psychology. I work in the
  Attention and Cognitive Control Lab, looking at metacognition as well as trust
  and confidence in human-machine teaming.

My background involves a BSc in Computer Science, an MSc in Human-Computer Interaction from UCL, a placement within Customer Experience Management and user research on data visualisation, interface design and situational awareness within a children's hospital.

Truth be told, I still have a lot to learn both in academia broadly and in my current field of research. So here's a blog with me capturing my thoughts from academic work, as well as other miscellanea that you may like. Enjoy!
