  Welcome to Qubit, a blog written by Sriraj Aiyer. Qubit will cover a variety
  of topics, likely circling in on human-computer interaction, AI, cognitive
  science, psychology, life in academia and other miscellaneous items that seem
  pertinent or otherwise interesting. I have a lot of thoughts during any given
  day, so it seemed a decent goal to capture at least some of them. Please feel
  free to explore some of my posts and find out a little bit more about me!   



  The reason for the name Qubit is that I like the idea of taking a unit so
  fundmental to all computing and changing how we conceptualise it to
  potentially change our way of doing things. It's a nice allegory for life:
  sometimes to come up with a solution to a problem, we need a different
  perspective on the very building blocks of that problem. Someimtes you need to
  go back to basics and revisit what is most important. Plus the very idea of
  qubits is just so fascinating to me:
